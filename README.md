# Preliminary Geometrical Design and Analysis of a Tilt-Rotor Transitional UAV

<h2>Abstract</h2>

The present work included the preliminary geometrical design and analysis of a tilt-rotor transitional UAV based on combining the conventional approaches of fixed wing and multi-rotor design. Preliminary design parameters were derived using simulations in MATLAB/Octave, which formed the basis for the initial design geometry. The model aircraft was analysed using XFLR5 program for aerodynamic stability. Detailed CAD models were prepared using Solidworks software. RANS CFD simulations were performed using ANSYS Fluent to validate the design.
The proposed objectives of the project were successfully achieved. The various dimensions of Tilt-Rotor UAV including, but not limited to, area of the wing, rotor propeller size and power house requirement was computed and Lift force was correctly calculated. Pressure and velocity fields were visualised using ParaView and were found to be coherent with the expected phenomena.
